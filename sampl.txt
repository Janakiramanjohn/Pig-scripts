
Use case 1: 
To get all the details from the transaction amount detail that is greater than with a specific amount which the user wants.
Execution Script:
a= load '/user/cloudera/Transactional.dat' using PigStorage(',');
b = foreach a generate $2,$3;
c = filter b by $1>160;
dump c;
store c into ‘/user/cloudera/task1’;
 
Use case 2:
Count all the transaction where amount is between 175 to 200.

Execution Script:
A = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage (',') as (tid, d, uid, amt : double , cat, prod,city,state,pt);
B = foreach  A generate tid, amt;
C = filter B by ($1>170 and $1<200);
D = foreach C generate 1 as one;
E = group D by one;
F = foreach E generate COUNT(D.one);
dump F;
Use case 3:
Calculate the total sum and total count of all the transaction for each user id.

Execution Script:
step1 = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',');
step2 = foreach step1 generate $2 as uid,$3 as amt;
step3 = group step2 by uid;
step4 = foreach step3 generate group, SUM(step2.amt);
dump step4;

Use case 4:
Calculate the average transaction value for each user id.
Execution Script:
step1 = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',');
step2 = foreach step1 generate $2 as uid,$3 as amt;
step3 = group step2 by uid;
step4 = foreach step3 generate group, SUM(step2.amt),COUNT(step2.amt),AVG(step2.amt);
dump step4;
Use case 5:
Calculate total sales amt for each Month.
Execution Script:
a = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (tid,tdate:chararray,uid,amt:double,cat,acc,city,state,pay);
b = foreach a generate SUBSTRING(tdate,0,2) as mon, amt;
c = group b by mon;
d = foreach c generate group, SUM(b.amt) as sum;
dump d;
Use case 6:
Divide the file into 12 files, each file containing each month of data. For eg. file1 should contain data of january txn, file 2 should contain data of feb txn.
Execution Script:
a = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (tid,tdate:chararray,uid,amt:double,cat,acc,city,state,pay);;
b = foreach a generate SUBSTRING(tdate,0,2) as month,tid,tdate,uid,amt,cat,acc,city,state,pay;
c = filter b by month=='01';
dump c;
d = filter b by month=='02';
dump d;
e = filter b by month=='03';
dump e;
f = filter b by month=='04';
dump f;
g = filter b by month=='05';
dump g;
h = filter b by month=='06';
dump h;
i = filter b by month=='07';
dump i;
j = filter b by month=='08';
dump j;
k = filter b by month=='09';
dump k;
l = filter b by month=='10';
dump l;
m = filter b by month=='11';
dump m;
n = filter b by month=='12'; dump n;

Use case 7:
Find the name of top 3 spenders.
Execution Script:
a = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (tid,tdate,uid:int,amt:double,cat,acc,city,state,pay);
b = load '/user/cloudera/custs-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as
(uid:int,fname:chararray,lname,age,prof);
c = join a by uid,b by uid;
d = foreach c generate $2 as uid, $3 as amt,$10 as fname;
e = group d by (uid,fname);
f = foreach e generate group, SUM(d.amt) as Total;
g = order f by Total DESC;
h = limit g 3;
dump h;
Use case 8:
Find the profession of user who has spend the maximum amount.
Execution Script:
a = load '/user/cloudera/txns-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as (tid,tdate,uid:int,amt:double,cat,acc,city,state,pay);
b = load '/user/cloudera/custs-large.dat' using PigStorage(',') as
(uid:int,fname:chararray,lname,age,prof:chararray);
c = join a by uid,b by uid;
d = foreach c generate $2 as ID,$3 as tamt,$13 as Prof;
f = group d by ($0,$2);
h = foreach f generate group,SUM(d.tamt) as Res;
i = order h by Res DESC;
j = limit i 1;  dump j;
